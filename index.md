### Current status

There is not much to see here yet. Behind the scenes there is a lot of design work going on. A few minor visible outputs of that are

* A [podcast](https://anchor.fm/pepijn-de-vos0) where I talk with IC designers. (the majority of the interviews so far were in private)
* [SimServer](https://github.com/NyanCAD/SimServer), an RPC API for streaming data from Ngspice, Xyce, CXXRTL & more
